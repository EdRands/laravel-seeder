# Enhanced Laravel Project Seeder Installer

This file is meant to make starting a new Laravel project even easier.

1. Place the laravel-seed script appropriate to your operating system into the directory where you keep your projects. For example, I use `c:\websites`
2. From a command line in that directory, run: `laravel-seed project-name`, replacing `project-name` with the name of the directory your project will call home.
