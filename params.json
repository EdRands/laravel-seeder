This project is meant to alleviate that problem, so I can get rolling on the actual project fast.\r\n\r\nThis package is not meant to be a dependency for other projects. It's meant to be used with Composer's `create-project` command.\r\n\r\nThis is meant mostly for my benefit, and in some regards is highly opinionated. But if it's helpful to you, you're welcome to start your own Laravel based projects with it, or fork it and customize it to your needs.\r\n\r\nThere's a significant change to the layout from the base Laravel install. In anticipation of making more advanced projects, I've started following more advanced practices that involve breaking things up far beyond the basic MVC layout. Most of the files have moved out of the `app` directory into `src`. Everything is namespaced, and seperated into composers, observers, repositories, and lots of other parts. I've mostly followed the first part of [Dayle Rees' \"Breaking the Mold\"](http://daylerees.com/breaking-the-mold).\r\n\r\n### What's In This Thing\r\n\r\n[Laravel](http://laravel.com/), of course. Wouldn't be much of a Laravel project seeder without that. It's version 4.2 right now.\r\n\r\nLots of projects use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for their front end framework, so version 3.1 of that is included. Also included is [Bootstrapper](https://packagist.org/packages/patricktalmadge/bootstrapper), a Laravel way to generate Bootstrap compatible markup. handy for complex things like menus.\r\n\r\nIcons. [Lots of icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) via [Font Awesome v4.1](http://fontawesome.io/). 439 at last count.\r\n\r\nTesting is important, if for no other reason than the developer's peace of mind. Therefore the seeder includes [Codeception](http://codeception.com/) framework and [Mockery](https://github.com/padraic/mockery). These tools make testing easier, almost fun, and therefore more likely testing will actually happen.\r\n\r\nContinuous integration is a great way to automate testing and maintenance. Configuration files for several CI services are included. [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) runs all the tests on push and pull requests. [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com) runs a variety of scripts to check your code for security holes, sloppy code, and coding style problems. Keep in mind you still need to turn each service on for your project.\r\n\r\nIDEs and code editors don't really understand the Laravel facade system, and so they have trouble giving you code suggestions and documentation for a lot of Laravel's functionality. To compensate for this, the [Laravel IDE Helper Generator](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper) is included. Each time you update in Composer, a helper file is generated that your editor can understand.\r\n\r\n[Laravel 4 Debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) is enabled in the development environment to provide information overload about what's happening when you load a page.\r\n\r\nTo help help speed up workflow, there's also [Jeffrey Way's generators](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators).\r\n\r\nI currently use [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) as my IDE, so the files for a NetBeans PHP project come along too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\n[Composer](http://getcomposer.org) must be installed on your system in order for this to work. But if you're working with Laravel, you probably have it installed all ready anyway.\r\n\r\n1. Open a command prompt in the directory where you keep your projects. For example, I'm running Windows and use `c:\\development`\r\n2. Now run `composer create-project edrands/laravel-seeder project-name` replacing `project-name` with the name of the directory for all your project's file. This must be a non-existent or empty directory.\r\n3. Wait while Composer automatically downloads the seed, installs all the dependencies, generates an IDE code completion helper, and generates a random hashing key.\r\n4. Follow the steps in `todo.md` in the root directory of your new project.\r\n5. Get working on the specifics of your project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute to this project, you can help in the typical GitHub way.\r\n\r\nIssues and pull requests should be filed on the [edrands/laravel-seeder](https://github.com/edrands/laravel-seeder) repository.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that since this seed is meant for the way I work, if you'd like customizations specific to the way you work, your best option is to fork this project and modify from there.\r\n\r\nIf your issue or pull request is related to Laravel itself, please see below about how to contribute to Laravel.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe Enhanced Laravel Project Seeder is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)","google":"UA-11203531-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
